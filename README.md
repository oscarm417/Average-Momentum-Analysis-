# Average-Momentum-Analysis-
A script that investigates the average lenght of a stocks momentum, to determine the best place to sell on a trend. 
Short term momentum seems to average at around 13 days, based on moving averages. Its my theory that stocks with long term trends,
in conjunction with the knowledge that stocks will trend for about 13 days, or 3 weeks (counting business days, with the market open), 
will yield favorable short term trading opportunities.
